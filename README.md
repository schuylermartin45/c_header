# Header Files

This repo contains the "header files" (i.e. templates) I like to use in my work.
It is the style I've developed and like to maintain for my C code and I have
since expanded the style.

It is based off of the style we used in my OS and Systems Programming courses
at the Rochester Institute of Technology and Professor Warren Cartihers.

## Languages Included
* C
* Python3
* MATLAB

I will note that I only use MATLAB for image processing and Computer Vision
work so the files I have included are geared towards that kind of work.
